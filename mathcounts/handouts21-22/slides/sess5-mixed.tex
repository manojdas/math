    Shane cuts out a paper circle of radius 7 cm. He then draws two perpendicular chords, as shown, with one a distance of 1 cm from the center and the other 3 cm from the center. Next, Shane folds the bottom of the circle up along the first chord and then folds the left side of the folded circle to the right along the second chord. If the folded arcs intersect at a point P, as shown, what is the distance from the vertex of the right angle formed by the folds to P? Express your answer in simplest radical form.

    Triangle $ABC$ has $AB=21$, $AC=22$ and $BC=20$. Points $D$ and $E$ are located on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, such that $\overline{DE}$ is parallel to $\overline{BC}$ and contains the center of the inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$. Then $DE=m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.	

    \textit{Hint: The incenter is at the intersection of angle bisectors.}

    Two mathematicians take a morning coffee break each day. They arrive at the cafeteria independently, at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and stay for exactly $m$ minutes. The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \%,$ and $m = a - b\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c.$
