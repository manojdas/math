% Difficulty: 1 • Answer: 2 faces
\begin{frame}[t]{5.1}
\begin{block}{}
    Jamie rolled a standard six-sided die that has each face painted either red, green or blue. In 100 rolls, the die landed with a red face up 50 times, with a blue face up 17 times, and with a green face up 33 times. Based on this data, how many faces of the die would you expect to be green?

% Difficulty: 1 • Answer: 24
\begin{frame}[t]{5.2}
\begin{block}{}
  How many three-digit numbers greater than 700 can be formed using the digits 1, 3, 4, 7 and 9, if no repetition of digits is allowed in a number?

% Difficulty: 2 • Answer: 44/125 
\begin{frame}[t]{5.3}
\begin{block}{}
 A large cube is dipped into red paint and then divided into 125 smaller congruent cubes. One of the smaller cubes is then randomly selected. What is the probability that the cube selected will have at least $25\%$ of its surface area painted red? Express your answer as a common fraction.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

% Difficulty: 2 • Answer: 5/9 
\begin{frame}[t]{5.4}
\begin{block}{}
    The nine regions on a spinner are numbered with positive integers 1 through 9, and the probability of the spinner landing on a given region is proportional to the label for that region. For example, since $4 \times 2 = 8$, the probability of landing on 8 is twice the probability of landing on 4. What is the probability that this spinner will land on an odd number? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Two standard six-sided dice, each with faces numbered with the positive integers 1 through 6, have the probability distribution shown for the sum of the top-facing values on the dice. Two non-standard but fair six-sided dice can be numbered differently with nonnegative integers on each face and still yield the same probability distribution. Though a number may be on both dice, a number may not appear more than once on either die. If $a$ is the sum of the six numbers on one of these non-standard dice, and $b$ is the sum of the six numbers on the other die, what is the value of the product $a \times b$?
