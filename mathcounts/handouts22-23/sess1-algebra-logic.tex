    A firefighter uses the formula $S = 0.5 N + 26$ to determine the maximum number of feet of horizontal distance ($S$) water will travel leaving a hose with a $\frac{3}{4}$-inch nozzle diameter. $N$ is the nozzle pressure in pounds. If the hose has a nozzle diameter greater than $\frac{3}{4}$-inch, 5 feet is added to the distance for every $\frac{1}{8}$-inch increase in nozzle diameter. For a $1\frac{1}{8}$-inch diameter nozzle with a nozzle pressure of 80 pounds, what is the maximum horizontal distance in feet that the water will travel?
